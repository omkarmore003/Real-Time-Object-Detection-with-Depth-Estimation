# 👁️ Smart Vision: Real-Time Object Detection with Depth Estimation

A real-time smart vision system for **object detection** and **distance feedback**, specially designed to assist visually impaired users.  
This system integrates **YOLOv8** for object detection and **MiDaS** for depth estimation, providing **auditory feedback** on the proximity of detected objects using **text-to-speech**.

## 📸 Live Demo

Real-time video processing via **IP Webcam** with object zone feedback:
- `"Very close"`
- `"Nearby"`
- `"Far away"`

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **YOLOv8 (Nano)** for real-time object detection  
- 🧠 **MiDaS_small** for monocular depth estimation  
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech feedback** using `pyttsx3`  
- 🖥️ **Automatic window placement** to bottom-right of screen  
- 🧠 **Zone Classification**: Categorizes objects as **Very Close**, **Nearby**, or **Far Away**  
- 📡 **Supports IP Webcam input** for mobile camera streaming

## 🖥️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omkarmore003/Real-Time-Object-Detection-with-Depth-Estimation
cd Real-Time-Object-Detection-with-Depth-Estimation
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download Models
YOLOv8: yolov8n.pt is automatically downloaded by the ultralytics package.

MiDaS: Automatically downloaded using torch.hub.

No manual model download is required.

4. Configure IP Webcam (Mobile Camera)
Install IP Webcam Android app.

Connect your phone and PC to the same Wi-Fi.

Start the camera server on phone.

Replace the following line in object.py with your IP:

python
Copy
Edit
ip_camera_url = "http://<your-phone-ip>:8080/video"
▶️ Run the Application
bash
Copy
Edit
python object.py
Press q to quit the video stream window.

📐 Distance Estimation Logic
Real-world distance is estimated using the depth map from MiDaS:

python
Copy
Edit
distance = k / depth_value
depth_value is the normalized depth value.

k = 0.8 is a scaling factor (adjustable depending on camera calibration).

Zone Classification:
Distance	Zone
< 1.0 m	Very Close
< 3.0 m	Nearby
> 3.0 m	Far Away

🗣️ Voice Feedback Example
"person very close, 0.80 meters"

"bicycle nearby, 2.45 meters"

"car far away, 5.78 meters"

Voice messages are played asynchronously using threads for non-blocking alerts.
